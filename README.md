# folder_duration
Measures the total duration of all of the wav files in a folder

# Installation
`pip install folder-duration`

But.. I recommend using pipx, so it's always available for you.

`sudo apt install pipx`  
`pipx install folder-duration`

# Usage
```folder-duration -p /path/to/your/folder```

# This script works with Python3.8 and above. 
I don't test earlier versions.
